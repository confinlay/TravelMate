# TravelMate
This repository contains a project I worked on as part of a "Software Design Analysis" module at University. I acted as one of 4 team leads amongst a group of 16 engineers developing an Android app for creating and sharing travel itineraries as well as conducting your travels safely. As the weeks went on, the division of labour became more sophisticated as individuals split off into UI design, DevOps and Engineering teams. The app was fully functional and included a backend database hosted on FireBase, as well as making extensive use of the Google Maps API. A short demo of the app can be seen in 3 parts below:
